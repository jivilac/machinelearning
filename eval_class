6. Evaluate Classifier: you can use any metric you choose for this assignment
(accuracy is the easiest one – we will not usually use accuracy but it’s fine for
this assignment). Feel free to evaluate it on the same data you built the model on
(this is not a good idea in general but for this assignment, it is fine). We haven't
covered models and evaluation yet, so don't worry about creating validation sets
or cross-validation.
